			<h3>Track Your Scores</h3>
			<p>We aim to make keeping track of your past rounds as simple as possible. Only enter the bare minimum of information for each round, including course slope, rating and your score. We like to keep it simple, but you can track even more information if you like. It's up to you!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="third">
			<h3>Calculate Your Handicap</h3>
			<p>Calculating your handicap is not a trivial process. It seems like the rules were developed to be as complicated as possible. Let Handicappr take over the heavy lifting... Just enter your scores and we'll do the rest!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="third last">
			<h3>Keep Tabs on Your Friends</h3>
			<p>Golf is a social game, and knowing what your playing partners have been up to on the course is always interesting. Handicappr lets you follow your friends to see how they're scoring, as well as letting you create your own groups (because we can't all belong to a posh country club)</p>
